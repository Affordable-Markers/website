Trinity is a Christian union of three (Father, Son, Holy Ghost) in one Godhead. This Memorial is the union of three pieces into one beautiful memorial set. The main monument is 30"wide x 6" thick x 18" tall, polished all around, sitting on an all polished sub base with built in vases. This set sits on a 48" wide x 12" deep x 8" thick base.  The listed price is for Gray, but each of the three pieces can be produced in the color of your choice.
