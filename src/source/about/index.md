Our company was founded in 1992. Ten years after inception, we expanded our services to include gravestone inscriptions for National Cemeteries. We have serviced 17 National Cemeteries, and to date have inscribed over 500,000 memorial headstones for our veterans. While providing this service, we noticed a real need to help families who were experiencing the over-inflated prices quoted by the local gravestone dealers. In 2008, we launched Affordable Markers in order to help with this need.

Since then, Affordable Markers has received heartfelt and rewarding feedback for our grave markers and service. Families can now afford to mark the resting places of loved ones that have been unmarked for years, even decades. With our guaranteed low price and lifetime warranty, Affordable Markers is your solution for top quality granite markers and excellent customer service.
