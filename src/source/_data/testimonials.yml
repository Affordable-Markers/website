        I don’t know how to put in words how great your company is.

        I ordered a pet marker for my best friends companion (Bandit) that had passed away in November 2009. Bandit would have been 12 in December. I initially ordered the marker with the date Bandit passed away as December. Once I realized I had made a mistake, I was in a panic. One call to your customer service was all it took to correct the error. I was told the date would be corrected and the marker would ship on Friday. I received a call from you guys to tell me that the way the dates were on my order would cause a problem. He suggested a four line marker instead of a three line. I told him that would be fine. The next day I was sent a proof and the marker looked even better than I had thought. When the marker arrived, I made plans with one other friend to present the marker to Bandits owners. When we sat the marker in front of them, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house. They were so pleased with the marker, they couldn’t speak.

        All I can say is that I have told everyone I know about your company. I have given your web site out to each one. Keep up the good work guys. Ya’ll are number one in my book.

        I am very satisfied with the product and the service. Years ago, my family waited for many months and through many follow up calls to get my mother’s marker for her grave. From a local supplier here in suburban Philadelphia. I looked around for a local supplier here, but none could compare to your price; I did not expect the prompt delivery – so it was amazing to me that within two weeks after I ordered, the marker turned up on my doorstep. From California. With free shipping. It’s an amazing world we live in – where I can get better service 3000 miles away than I can get 3 miles away. Needless to say, I am very pleased, and will not hesitate to recommend your company given the opportunity.

        Thank you for being a ray of sunshine in what can be a very draining process.

        Hello,

        Thank you so much for the wonderful service I received while purchasing the grave marker for my mother's grave site. I am so pleased with my purchase. If I had not found your company I probably would not have been able to afford a marker for my mom. You have relieved a burden that I have been feeling for a very long time and I can not express how much this means to me and my family.

        Thank you for caring about the families of the dearly departed enough to enable us to be able to afford something nice to remember them by. My prayers are with you and I love you for making this difference in my life. 
        Sincerely,

        When I received my mother's grave marker I must say it was MORE than I had expected. I am very impressed by the workmanship and the quality of the marker for the reasonable price. Not to mention the fact that you sent it out so promptly. I received the marker within a few days of ordering it and it arrived packaged very well, with no breakage. You are truly a 5 Star company and I WILL be telling people about your company. Thank you for making a tragic life experience a little more bearable.

        Thank You,

        Your help, understanding and service were absolutely excellent. The marker arrived in plenty of time and was in place for our final goodbye to my wife and was a very great comfort for me and my family. Also the craftsmanship and quality was superb. I can’t thank you and your staff enough for your extemporary service and conduct during what is a very difficult time for us.
        Thank you again,

        We have received the marker and are very satisfied with the quality. It came in perfect condition. Your office staff was extremely helpful to me, as I called at least 2 times with questions. Calling me back so promptly is quite unusual in today’s business and I really appreciated it. Thank you for your help.

        I was Very impressed how quickly I received my Marker! Especially having to be shipped from California to Massachusetts. The turn around time was incredible as well! I am a licensed Funeral Director so I know what these Markers normally cost. I purchased this Marker for my Spouse’s Grandmother who is buried in W. Virginia. We are driving down to FL on Thursday and plan to stop in W. VA to install her Marker. Thanks so much for the “Great Service” not to mention the incredible price! It had to cost half of the price of the Marker just for the shipping and packaging costs. Thanks again! I will definitely send more business your way!

        I manage a large public cemetery that averages 325 burials yearly. I see lots of beautiful stones, most with large price tags. I am impressed with the quality of the nice stone you engraved for my Dad. It is the type of stone and color that holds up the best to irrigation, weather and machinery at my cemetery. The real beauty of your system is the design choices I was given on your website. I came away feeling I had just ordered a custom headstone at a great delivered price, and I had the stone in a week!
        Thanks again,

        I was amazed at the quick processing and shipping and couldn’t be more pleased with Tommy’s marker. It really is beautiful and everything I wanted. It was a comfort to our family as well, to see this tasteful dignified and well designed marker to honor Tommy. I pray that I will never need your services again, but if should that ever be the case I wont hesitate to order from you again. “Affordable” doesn’t mean “cheap”! Thank you again, so much!

        I really do appreciate the hard work you committed on the marker for my Grandmother. You went above and beyond providing excellent customer service. You were patient with me and made sure everything was exactly as I requested. Thank you for your help. You made a situation no one wants to be in very pleasant. I would HIGHLY recommend your company to anyone needing a marker or memorial. Again, thank you for your awesome service and professionalism.

        I would like to tell you how much I appreciate your company. My Mother’s marker arrived in about a week and it was exactly as I designed it. The workmanship was quality, the packaging was done with care, and the affordability was truly a gift to a family that couldn’t afford a lot. I spoke with Hunter on the phone and he was so considerate. He went beyond just sending an email to tell me it had been shipped and called in person. This type of personal care makes all the difference. People in this day and time rarely show caring like that anymore. I would, without hesitation recommend your company to anyone. Thank you so very much.

        I would like to take the time to thank you for the beautiful grave marker that you made me. Workmanship was awesome and it is exactly what was promised. The price was so affordable… I hope you fully understand how much you help people afford a nice grave marker that couldn’t otherwise. Word of mouth is the best advertisement and I have a big mouth. Great work…thanks so much.

        We are very please with your service. We had a wide variety of images, lettering, sayings, and ease of use. Your service allowed my family to purchase a headstone for my 4-month old great-granddaughter. Funeral expenses drained our wallet’s. It was so wonderful to be able to do this for her. We were so very, very pleased with your product. Keep up the good work.

        I am very, very impressed with the cemetery marker that I ordered. I ordered this marker for our family cemetery to show the name and the year est. I looked for months. I was mainly checking on signs made of metal. The price of all the signs were almost as expensive; and a lot of the signs were more expensive; and not near the quality and the look….I would recommend your services to anyone!!
        Thanks again,

        *Very affordable* which is a gift… finished marker done in the blink of an eye… shipped from CA to GA in standard 6 days ground surface as there obviously was no time wasted between finished product and shipping. Craftsman-ship on the marker was excellent for the reasonable amount paid. I cannot comment on granite grade as I am not a grader but it appeared to be of good grade as I live in GA where we are not unfamiliar with granite. I live 13 miles from the largest exposed granite formation in the world at Stone Mountain, GA. To sum it up…your company is a class act from initial contact to follow up after the sale with a price that is affordable to many that could not afford most other competitors in the same marker arena.
        Well done… well done indeed,
